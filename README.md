Bus Mall project
Author: Lucas Wilber

This Bus Mall webapp aims to gather data about customer preferences between an assortment of silly toys, by repeatedly asking the visitor to choose their favorite out of a few options. The visitor can decide how many options they want to choose from and how many times they want to make a choice, then the results are displayed with a chart made using Chart.js. Results are saved on local storage and incremented at the end of each "game".

chart labels color fixed with help from PhantomSalt (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/37292423/chart-js-label-color)

color palette chosen with help from paletton.com
